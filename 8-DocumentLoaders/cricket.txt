Cricket – The Gentleman's Game

Beneath the sun, on fields so wide,
The players take their stance with pride.
A willow bat, a leather ball,
The umpire's nod, the captain’s call.

The bowler runs with focused eyes,
The batsman reads the ball that flies.
A crack! The shot sails through the air,
The crowd erupts, joy everywhere.

The slip stands still, a catch, a chance,
A moment’s pause, a silent glance.
Then cheers or groans fill up the air,
For fortune sways without a care.

Each over spins a brand-new tale,
With swinging seam or drifting gale.
The spinner loops it slow and tight,
The batter reads with all his might.

The fielders dive, they chase, they slide,
With passion that they cannot hide.
A six! It clears the boundary rope,
And fills each fan with gleaming hope.

From gully shots to cover drives,
Cricket breathes in countless lives.
Be it street or grand world stage,
It unites all hearts, age to age.

With tea-time tales and match-day roars,
It’s more than just the runs and scores.
For cricket holds a nation’s soul,
A game of heart, of grit, of goal.

So here's to wickets, wins, and flair—
To cricket, played with love and care.
