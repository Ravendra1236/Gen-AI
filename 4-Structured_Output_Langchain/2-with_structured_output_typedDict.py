# Long battery life with fast charging

# Problem with typedDict : 
# Only for representation not data validation 
# May be our LLM give int instead of str
# so thats why we use pydantic for data validation


# Why typedDict is not applying for gemini 
# üîç Reason: TypedDict is a static typing tool, not a runtime validator
# TypedDict (from Python's typing module) is used only for type hints‚Äîit's not a real class with methods or structure at runtime.

# So when LangChain or any structured output parser tries to:

# Validate

# Instantiate

# Enforce schema

# Parse values into objects

# ‚Ä¶it cannot use TypedDict because it doesn't exist at runtime as a schema object. It's just metadata for editors and linters (e.g., for mypy, Pyright).
