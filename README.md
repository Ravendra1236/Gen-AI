## 🚀 What This Repository Covers

This repository is focused on **practical learning** and contains:

- 📚 **Hands-on examples** using LangChain and various LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- 🛠️ Mini projects like Chatbots, PDF Q&A, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and more
- 📓 Detailed notes and explanations for each concept I learn
- 🔍 Experiments integrating tools like **Vector DBs (e.g. FAISS, Chroma)** and **Embeddings**
- 🧩 Exploration of LangChain components: Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory, Prompts

## 🎯 Goals

I started this repo to:
- Understand how GenAI can be used in real-world applications
- Learn how to **orchestrate LLMs** using LangChain
- Document my personal progress in the AI/LLM ecosystem
- Build a strong foundation in creating AI-driven apps
